A simple WordPress plugin for managing projects and tasks. Integrated into BuddyPress Groups for best collaborative experience.  

== Description ==

<h3>Group Project and Task Management</h3>

Manage your Projects and assign a Task to each of the Group's Members. You can set the priority for each task (Normal, High, Critical). TaskBreaker also sends an email to members when there is a new task update available or if they are assigned to a new task.

<h4>Introducing File Attachments</h4>

File attachments for Tasks are now available for version 1.4.1 and above. We are still working to integrate the File Attachment feature inside the Task Comments. The primary goal is to make it easier for group members to share files with each other in a particular task.

Your feedback is highly appreciated.

<h4>Caveats</h4>

TaskBreaker is tightly integrated with BuddyPress (<a href="https://buddypress.org/">https://buddypress.org/</a>). With that said, TaskBreaker will not work if BuddyPress is not installed or if BuddyPress Groups Component is not enabled.
